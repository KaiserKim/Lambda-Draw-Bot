Lambda Drawbot
==============

This is the build project for the Lambda Pledge Class of the Theta Tau Epsilon Delta chapter. We are making an Arduino robot that can draw shapes using pre-made functions. 

So far, the project consists of the following materials: 

	* Arduino Uno
	* External battery charger for Android / iPhones (used to externally power the Arduino)
	* Two continuous servo motors with wheels
	* One standard servo motor with rubber band so that the pen can be attached
	* LaserCAMM cut acrylic

It is highly recommended you compile and develop your main driver on the Arduino IDE if you are a beginner. You can [download it here][arduino_download].

A picture of how our robot is set up is provided to help you with reproduction. AutoCAD files are also provided in case you are planning to use LaserCAMM or a similar product to cut out your acrylic. Please note that the code we provide should work on *most* robots with this particular style in mind.

**Note:** The code and instructions provided are specifically catered for our continuous servo motors. If you are planning to do a similar project, be sure to modify the constants.h file to calibrate your particular motors. Not all servo motors come out of the factory the same!

Functions
--------------

Here is the current list of functions in the Lambda Drawbot, starting with the wheel functions:

Function      | Parameters    | Description                                                        
------------- |-------------- | ---------------
forward       | int duration  | Moves the drawbot forward for "duration", which is in milliseconds. 
backward      | int duration  | Moves the drawbot backward for "duration", which is in milliseconds. 
stopBot       | int duration  | Stops the drawbot for "duration", which is in milliseconds. 
turnLeft      | int duration  | Turns the drawbot left for "duration", which is in milliseconds. 
turnRight     | int duration  | Turns the drawbot right for "duration", which is in milliseconds. 

Because continuous servos are just modified standard servos, they can only be programmed to spin for a certain amount of time. Therefore, trial and error is required if you desire your robot to turn *exactly* a certain way. Some constants for turning a robot exactly 90 degrees based on duration is provided in the constants.h file.

Here are the pen functions:

Function      | Parameters    | Description                                                        
------------- |-------------- | ---------------
penUp         | None          | Lifts the writing utensil up.
penDown       | None          | Puts the writing utensil down.

If the pen is down, the pen is in drawing mode and marks will be left on the floor, so be careful.
